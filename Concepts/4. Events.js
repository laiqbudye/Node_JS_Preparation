What is Event?
   something that has happened in our app that we can respond to.

there are two type of events in nodeJs
  1. System Events 
        - events coming from computer system like I finished reading a file, a file is open, I have received data from internet & other things like that JS doesnt have.
        - libuv library provides all these.

  2. Custom Events
        - they are inside JS core
        - they are not from libuv library.
