Pipes
  connecting two streams by writing to one stream what is being read from another.
  
  lets say we have two streams 1. readable 2. writable
  
  readble is reading some data & writable is writing some data.
  
  so we can read data from readable stream & pass same data to writable stream using PIPE.
