Module-
  is a re-usable block of code 
  
  Js didnt have this before (there was a workaround but modules were not officially supported)


Functions are first class citizens in JS
  1. We can assign a function to a variable
  2. We can pass one function as a param to another function 
  3. We can return a function from a function
Considering all these, Functions are first class citizens in JS.
