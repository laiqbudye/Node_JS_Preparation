Versioning:-
  specifying what version of this code is
  e.g 1.1.1  (consider this as current version of app)
  
verion is based on this:- Major.Minor.Patch

Patch - when we fix any bug or something we increment this  (1.1.2)
Minor - when we add small new feature, increment this (1.2.0)
Major - when we add some big feature, or complete change of look n feel of our app then increment this (2.0.0)

here, number means something which is why it is called as Semantic Versioning.
